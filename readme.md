Hello GitHub World

## Interest: Love sports and music. Recently focusing in tennis and learning some golf! I like all kinds of music, and rn I'm dying to go to a rodeo in the US.
## Bio: Originally from Puebla, a beautiful city close to Mexico City. Love sports, but sadly suck at them. I never lose faith I'll find the one I'm good at though.
